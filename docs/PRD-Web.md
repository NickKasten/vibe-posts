## üéØ Objective

Build a fast, secure web app that lets developers generate polished LinkedIn posts from:
- Recent GitHub activity (commits, PRs)
- Optional personal context (e.g., what was built or learned)
- A selected writing style (technical, casual, inspiring)

The app provides inline editing and one-click publishing to LinkedIn using user-supplied API tokens. It prioritizes minimal setup, clean UX, and cloud convenience.

## üë• Target Users

- Developers who:
  - Regularly commit code to GitHub
  - Want to increase visibility on LinkedIn
  - Prefer a frictionless, browser-based experience

---

## üîê Security Considerations

### Token Handling
- Tokens stored securely using Supabase (or localStorage with encryption)
- Tokens never logged or shared externally
- All sensitive interactions occur client-side or via secured backend endpoints

### Prompt Injection Protection
- Input sanitization
- Structured prompt formatting
- Output validation for hallucinations and safety
