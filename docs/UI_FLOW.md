## 🤖 3. AI-Led Adaptive Questions (Max 5)

Before starting the AI-led Q&A, the user is given an option:
- `Answer questions to build my post`
- `Skip to drafting`

If the user chooses to skip, they are taken directly to the Live Post Draft + Editing Assistant with a blank or minimal draft.

### If GitHub data found:
**AI opens with:**
> “Looks like you pushed a big update to `vibe-agent` and merged a CI fix. What was that about?”

### If no data or skipped:
> “What’s something you worked on or learned this week?”

### Follow-ups (conditional):
1. “Did you work with anyone you'd like to highlight?”
2. “Any big decisions, launches, or lessons?”
3. “Where did this work happen — at a company, project, school?”
4. “Anything you’d like people to take away from this?”

Allow user to:
- Type directly
- Skip any question
- See running context building on side
