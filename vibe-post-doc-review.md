# 📋 Vibe-Post Developer Documentation Review

## ✅ What You’ve Done Well

| Area | Highlights |
|------|------------|
| **Clarity & Consistency** | Terminology, architecture, and flows align across the PRD, developer guide, and dev plan. |
| **Security** | Strong token handling, prompt injection protection, and output validation. `SECURITY.md` is clean, practical, and enforceable. |
| **Modular Architecture** | Well-organized folder structure in `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` with separation of concerns. |
| **Prompt Structure & Validation** | Great use of JSON schema + structured prompt template = reliable downstream AI integration. |
| **Scalability Considerations** | You plan for multiple AI providers, fallback models, and future growth (post-MVP roadmap). |
| **Human-Centered UI** | `UI_FLOW.md` is unusually well-designed for dev tooling: friendly, guided, and opt-in for automation. |

## 🧩 Suggestions & Gaps

### 1. Error Logging & Monitoring
- Add a section for logging errors and events (auth failures, AI errors, post API errors).
- Suggestion: Vercel logs, Sentry, or LogRocket.
- Add env variables like `LOG_LEVEL`, `SENTRY_DSN`.

### 2. Post-Scheduling Clarity
- Scheduling is in UI and dev plan but not PRD core features.
- Add to PRD feature table:
  ```
  | Scheduling | Choose a date/time for post publishing (optional) |
  ```

### 3. Session Expiry & Sign-out
- No mention of logout flow, session expiration, or device switching.
- Add brief handling notes to `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`.

### 4. Rate Limiting Strategy
- No plan for limiting calls to OpenAI/LinkedIn.
- Add throttling logic to avoid token issues or API bans.

### 5. Mobile Responsiveness
- Add responsive UI requirement to PRD Success Criteria.
- Include testing task in Day 6 of dev plan.

### 6. OAuth Refresh Flow Handling
- Noted token security but not token expiration.
- Suggest adding refresh token UX/policy to `SECURITY.md` or auth guide.

### 7. Metrics/Analytics Tracking
- Success metrics defined, but no mention of how they’re tracked.
- Add a note for simple analytics: Vercel Analytics, Plausible, etc.

## 🧠 Optional Post-MVP Enhancements

| Idea | Benefit |
|------|---------|
| AI Prompt History | Helps users reuse or learn from past prompts |
| Export as Markdown | Useful for external editing or reuse |
| LinkedIn Card Preview | Improves trust and UX for preview accuracy |

## ✅ Next Steps

- Incorporate suggestions as you iterate toward final release.
- Consider lightweight telemetry and responsive enhancements even during MVP phase.
